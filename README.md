# CCoscope
Compiler Construction, mixed with a custom language and LLVM Kaleidoscope, brewed together and still not working.

### Building

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Note: On debian-like systems, compilation may fail due to missing `-ledit`. This should be detected and reported by cmake's LLVM detection package, but for some reason it it's not, or maybe the debian package for `llvm-dev` is missing a dependency. Either way installing `libedit-dev` solves the issue.

### Running

```
./CCoscope
```
